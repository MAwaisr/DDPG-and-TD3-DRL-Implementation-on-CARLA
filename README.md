# Intelligent Path Planning for Self-Driving UGV





## Abstract
This project aims to advance intelligent path planning for self-driving Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) through the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We employ algorithms such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) to enhance the decision-making capabilities of UGVs.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
- **SDG 8**: Boosts economic growth by fostering innovation and creating high-end jobs.
- **SDG 9**: Advances smart infrastructure and introduces innovation to existing infrastructure.
